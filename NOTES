0.7.36

I *really* changed everything around.  Basically, I changed all the
Makefiles to fit in with the Linux kernel Makefiles.  Ideally, you
could now move the comedi directory to /usr/src/linux/drivers/char,
change a few files, and compile comedi into your kernel.

One of the side effects of changing the makefiles is that all
the drivers are compiled as separate modules.  Another side effect
is that I'd bet comedi doesn't compile correctly for 2.0.x kernels
and possibly RTL and/or RTAI.

I almost certainly broke a bunch of drivers.  Let me know which
ones.
