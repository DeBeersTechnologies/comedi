    COMEDI
    The Linux Control and Measurement Device Interface
    David Schleef <ds@schleef.org>


* About Comedi:

Comedi is a collection of drivers for data acquisition hardware.
These drivers work with Linux, and also with Linux combined with
the real-time extensions RTAI and RTLinux.  The Comedi core, which
ties all the driver together, allows applications to be written
that are completely hardware independent.

Comedi supports a variety of data acquisition hardware; an
incomplete list can be found in Documentation/comedi/drivers.txt.

This distribution contains just the Comedi kernel modules.  You will
almost certainly also want to download Comedilib, which is a user
space library, a few utilities, and some example programs.

* Installation:

For installation instructions, look at the file INSTALL.

* Mailing List:

Questions about Comedi should be sent to the Comedi mailing list,
<comedi_list@googlegroups.com>.  It is necessary to join the group
before posting (see below).  It is also possible to post to the list
using the web interface (see below).  Mailing the maintainer
directly is always acceptable, but since the mailing list is
archived and questions are often answered more quickly by others,
the mailing list is preferred.

To subscribe to and unsubscribe from the mailing list, or to read or
post messages via the web interface, go to
<http://groups.google.com/group/comedi_list>.  Alternatively, you
can send a blank email to <comedi_list+subscribe@googlegroups.com>
to subscribe, or to <comedi_list+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com> to
unsubscribe (making sure the "From:" email address matches the
address you originally subscribed with!).

Traffic on the list is light, and mainly questions/answers about
comedi installation, bugs, and programming.  General questions
about data acquisition are also welcome.

* More Information:

Comedi also has a web page at <http://www.comedi.org/> from where
updated versions may be downloaded.

Often bugfixes and new features that are not in the current release
can be found in the Git repository.  Git snapshots can be created
automatically at <http://comedi.org/git?p=comedi/comedi.git;a=tree>.
The Git repository can be accessed anonymously using:

  git clone git://comedi.org/git/comedi.git

Comedi may be freely distributed and modified in accordance with the
GNU General Public License.
