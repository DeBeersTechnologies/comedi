For installation instructions, look at the file INSTALL.  For notes
of what is happening/changing in recent comedi releases, see the
file NOTES.

This distribution contains just the Comedi kernel module.  You will
almost certainly also want to download Comedilib, which is a user
space library, a few utilities, and some example programs.

Comedi has a mailing list.  Send "subscribe comedi" to
comedi-request@stm.lbl.gov to subscribe.  Traffic is light, and mainly
questions/answers about comedi installation, bugs, and programming.
General questions about data acquisition are also welcome.
Alternatively, you can subscribe and unsubscribe at
http://stm.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/comedi.
You can always unsubscribe by sendinging "unsubscribe" (spell
it correctly!) to comedi-request@stm.lbl.gov.

Comedi also has a web page, at http://stm.lbl.gov/comedi.  New versions
of comedi can be found on the ftp site ftp://stm.lbl.gov/pub/comedi.

Instructions for anonymous CVS access to the Comedi and Comedilib
repositories are found at http://oss.lineo.com/cvs_anon.html.

Comedi may be freely distibuted and modified in accordance with the
GNU General Public License.
