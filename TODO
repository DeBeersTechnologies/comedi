comedi_rt_timer segfaults when the lower-level driver disappears
and reappears.  This is a problem with the Comedi core, not the
driver.  I don't really know how to fix this.

BUG in do_test_for_insn_bits() (due to -EACCES)  This happens when
another process is using a subdevice.

das6402 needs cleanup

fix PCI code, use pci_find_device()

standardize error codes

verify PCI-6503 code

get rid of spurious "char-major-98-0 not found"

different error code for board error vs buffer overflow

spinlocks

autoloading causes BUG on failure.

need realtime examples

das1800: kmalloc could fail on large buffer sizes (see dt282x)

move /proc/comedi to /proc/driver/comedi

- ao dma

- ai doesn't stop

- COMEDI_WAKE_EOS doesn't work with DMA

- munging config parameter

- ao "write: Invalid argument"

- buffer size issues

- devfs support
