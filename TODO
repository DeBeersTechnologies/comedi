bug: buffer resize to 0 convinces comedi that buffer doesn't exist

doc: how to use kcomedilib

comedi_rt_timer segfaults when the lower-level driver disappears
and reappears.  This is a problem with the Comedi core, not the
driver.  I don't really know how to fix this.  Actually, I do.
kcomedilib needs an implementation of comedi_open() and comedi_close().

das6402 needs cleanup

fix PCI code, use pci_find_device()

standardize error codes

get rid of spurious "char-major-98-0 not found"

different error code for board error vs buffer overflow

spinlocks

autoloading causes BUG on failure.

need realtime examples

das1800: kmalloc could fail on large buffer sizes (see dt282x).  Needs
to be fixed to use a bounce buffer.

move /proc/comedi to /proc/driver/comedi

Drivers that do DMA need to be fixed for big-endian machines.

Comedi should support devfs

ni_pcimio issues:

- ao dma

- ai doesn't stop with DMA

- COMEDI_WAKE_EOS doesn't work with DMA

- ao "write: Invalid argument" for initial write
