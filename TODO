mode[N] doesn't work until cmd is used.  Works in .57, not in
CVS.  I know how to fix this, but it needs other changes to
be done correctly.

mite.c expects that the buffer is vmalloc()ed.  This might not
be the case with real-time.  The planned fix for this is to
no longer allow real-time applications to allocate their own
buffer.

PCMCIA scripts are broken.  Installation documentation isn't correct
for PCMCIA.  

comedi_rt_timer segfaults when the lower-level driver disappears
and reappears.  This is a problem with the Comedi core, not the
driver.

BUG in do_test_for_insn_bits() (due to -EACCES)

ni_mio_common: doesn't do 2-chan ao.

das6402 needs cleanup

check each driver init for stuff

register_symtab

fix PCI code, use pci_find_device()

standardize error codes

verify PCI-6503 code

get rid of spurious "char-major-98-0 not found"

develop 8253 and Am9513 code

different error code for board error vs buffer overflow

spinlocks

add pci_enable_device where appropriate

autoloading causes BUG on failure.

adl_pci9118 doesn't differentiate between various PCI cards

adv_pci1710 doesn't differentiate between various PCI cards
