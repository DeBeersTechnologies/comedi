1. I get the error message:

Makefile:14: /usr/src/linux/.config: No such file or directory
make: *** No rule to make target `/usr/src/linux/.config'.  Stop.


It means you don't have the file /usr/src/linux/.config.  This file
contains all the configuration information about your linux kernel,
which comedi needs in order to compile correctly.  Some distributions
don't contain this file, so you will need to create your own, by
compiling your own kernel.  This file is automatically created
when you run 'make config', the first step in compiling a kernel.
