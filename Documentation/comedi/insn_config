INSN_CONFIG:

The first data element (data[0]) is an ID.

Generic return values:

  Bad ID: EINVAL  (should be EIO?)
  Length is wrong: EINVAL

  EAGAIN: changed arguments, retry (like command_test)


Notes:
  - Should we use the length as an ID? (no, cuz its dumb)
  - Should there be a generic flags parameter? (no)
  - Should trigger source configs return a token? (no)
  - Would it be better to have a special subdevice for trigger
    configuration? (no, because it goes against the "subdevices
    are independent" design.)
  - Should this configure generic triggers and return a token
    to be put into a command, or configure specific triggers
    that are tied to start_src, convert_src, etc.?


ID=0: COMEDI_INPUT
ID=1: COMEDI_OUTPUT
ID=2: open drain input (?)
ID=3: open drain output

  length=1
  chanspec is used to specify channel
  type: SUBD_DIO

  These are used to configure the direction of digital I/O lines.

  Modifications: none

  Errors: none

  Notes:
    - does open drain input make sense?


ID=xxx:  analog output waveform generation

  Specify the number of samples in buffer.

ID=xxx:  analog triggering

  length=N
  chanspec is ignored
  type: any with cmd

  [0] - ID
  [1] - analog trigger channel
  [2] - flags
          trigger
          slope/level
	  hysteresis
  [3] - high

  Modifications: ?
  Errors:
    - bad channel
    - bad flags
    - 
  Notes:
    - are there devices that can specify debouncing?
    - are there devices that can specify a time value after
      which the analog trigger resets?


ID=xxx: simple digital triggering

  length =
  chanspec is ignored
  type: any with cmd

  [0] - ID
  [1] - flags
          trigger 
  	  edge/level
	  rising/falling
  [2] - divider (?)

  Notes:
    - should this configure pins, or configure triggers?
      (ds: triggers, see independent subdevice design rule)
      (ds: pins, because it makes other things easier)
    - divider?  (ds: too complicated.  This is supposed to
      be simple.)
    - should this be encoded into the TRIG_EXT argument?
      

ID=xxx: extended digital triggering

  length =
  chanspec: ignored
  type: any with cmd

  [0] - ID
  [1] - flags
          trigger

  Notes:
    - should this be the same as triggering for counter/timers?


ID=xxx: counter configuration

  The subdevice has an accumulator which changes based on
  triggers.

  [0] - ID
  [ ] - flags
          generate command trigger when?
  [1] - mode
  [2] - source1_src
  [3] - source1_arg
  [4] - source2_src
  [5] - source2_arg
  [6] - gate_src
  [7] - gate_arg

  Modes:
    UP_COUNTER:
      acc++ on source1

    DOWN_COUNTER:
      acc-- on source1
    
    QUADRATURE:
      acc+=atan(source1,source2)

  Notes:
    - configuring pins vs. configuring triggers would make this
      easier


ID=xxx: counter configuration, up counter

  chanspec: used to determine particular counter channel

  [0] - ID
  [1] - flags
          up/down
  [2] - src (like command trigger)
  [3] - arg

  Notes:
    - too simple?  no gating

ID=xxx: counter configuration, up counter with gating
ID=xxx: counter configuration, quadrature


ID=xxx: command trigger, pattern matching

  [0] - ID
  [1] - bit mask (1 - watch, 0 - don't watch)
  [2] - bit pattern


ID=xxx: set software gate
  [0] - ID
  [1] - set/clear gate
